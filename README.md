# Principal-Component-analysis-model-with-data-analysis
This project, developed entirely by Kishan H S, applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the wine.csv dataset. The goal of this project is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, while retaining most of the variability in the data, and to visualize how the data can be transformed into a lower-dimensional space for further analysis. PCA helps in understanding the underlying structure of the dataset by identifying the most important features and visualizing the differences between different wine categories.
The wine.csv dataset consists of several chemical attributes measured for wines derived from three different cultivars. These attributes include:

Alcohol
Malic Acid
Ash
Alcalinity of Ash
Magnesium
Total Phenols
Flavanoids
Nonflavanoid Phenols
Proanthocyanins
Color Intensity
Hue
OD280/OD315 of Diluted Wines
Proline
